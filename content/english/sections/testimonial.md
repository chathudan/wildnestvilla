    content: "The Wild Nest Villa is exactly that... a beautiful nest hidden in the wilderness of the green village. We stayed in the 2 bedroom villa as part of our honeymoon to retreat back in nature, and we loved it so much we extended our stay. If you love nature and want a peaceful, private place to stay away from the hustle and bustle, then I highly recommend this villa. The host and staff are also very helpful and friendly but also very respectful regarding privacy. We would definitely stay longer if we could!."

    content: "If you want to feel true Sri Lankan hospitality, this place is definitely for you. In the amazing calm location with beautiful view. You will sleep among jungle trees and once you wake up in the morning- jump in the swimming pool for the best start of the day. Shashi became our good friend and we appreciated a lot the way he cared about us! We hope to come back one day to spend another day or two in this magical place."

    content: "Miejsce samo w sobie magiczne, przy zameldowaniu przywitały nas czarne małpki na podwórku, a pokoje były ładnie posprzątane. Zostaliśmy ugoszczeni miską owoców i super uśmiechem! Jeżeli chodzi o sam kontakt z gospodarzem, lepiej się nie dało.Na każda wiadomość odpowiedź przychodziła prawie że natychmiastowo. Polecam każdemu kto planuje wakacje przy Unawatuna na odwiedzenie tego miejsca."

    content: "The place itself is magical, and we were greeted by black monkeys in the backyard at check-in, and the rooms were nicely cleaned. We were welcomed with a bowl of fruit and a super smile! When it comes to contacting the host, you couldn't do better. Every message responded almost instantly. I recommend it to anyone planning a holiday at Unawatuna to visit this place."
