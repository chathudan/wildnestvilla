If you were to arrive in Galle Town from any direction, there are three things you will see right then and there that you cannot miss even if you wanted to; the Galle Bus Stand, the International Cricket stadium and just beyond that, standing tall and stretching wide in all its glory is the Galle Dutch Fort. It is a place where almost everyone is attracted to. The locals go there to relax and unwind, tourists go there to explore and experience, the local youth go there to fly kites or play cricket at the Ramparts Green near the army camp grounds, or hangout at the beach near the lighthouse, and almost everyone goes there to feel the ocean winds from atop the bastions and watch the sun do down into the horizon in a golden fiery haze. It is a place of beauty, joy, grandeur and multicultural, multi-ethnic importance. 

It is also a prominent landmark of the South, located in the heart of Galle City that is of cultural, historical and archeological significance. It has a history of over 400 years and remains intact and well preserved even to this day thanks to constant reconstruction and consistent maintenance. 


### Other things to do:

As mentioned before, the Galle Fort is a place where you can explore for hours and hours without ever having to retread your steps. It is an attractive place for anyone with at least a mild case of wanderlust since it is a place that has been designed and renovated in a tourist friendly way. 

If you begin your journey by entering through the tunnel that opens to the Stadium road, there is a roundabout in front of you right as you enter. You can walk in any direction and find interesting and cool places where you can buy souvenirs or taste delicious food and even find places to stay in such as the Rampart Hotel. 

For example, if you are interested in the history and the archeological aspects of the Galle Fort you can visit The National Maritime Museum. It is a museum that is built right into the walls of the fort and you can find it if you enter the Fort by walking along the Baladaksha Mawatha that leads directly there. In addition to that you can also explore the Galle Fort Clock Tower and also find and visit the many antique shops that exist in the Galle Fort. These places are warm little places that offer unique glimpses into the history and cultural background of the Galle Fort.

On the other hand, if you are not very enthusiastic about antique shops and history, you can of course explore the multitude of restaurants and bars that offer delicious food and beverages. Two places that house a wide array of such restaurants and shops are the Pedlar Street and The Dutch Hospital. In addition to all of these, there is also a beach and a lighthouse. All of these things in an area of 16.5 square kilometers. How cool is that!

### When to visit: 

The Galle Fort is bustling with activity almost all year around but if you are planning on trips to the beach and exploring the southern coast a bit more, it is advisable that you visit the Fort anytime between December and April. Moreover, the night life in Galle Fort is impeccable and tourists are guaranteed to have a safe and enjoyable time there, no matter what time of the day it is.


### How do I get there? 

The Galle Fort is hard to miss once you arrive in Galle City, especially because of its grandiosity. If you make it to Galle City on the train, after you exit the station, walk to the left over the bridge and once you turn right to cross the road, you will see the Galle Fort Clock Tower.

### What to wear and carry:

People come to the Galle Fort to basically relax and have some peace of mind so there are no restrictions or rules regarding the clothing anyone can wear. However, if you are planning on visiting the temple or the church inside the Fort you will have to dress accordingly. Other than that, you are free to wear whatever you like.

### Accessibility: 

In terms of accessibility, the Galle Fort is pretty much open to anyone and everyone. It is LGBTQ+ friendly and the Ramparts are open for anyone who brings their pets as well. The whole area has been recently renovated so that people with difficulties in walking or any kind of disabilities can have an easier time when exploring the Fort, especially the ramparts and the bastions. Children can be safe with their parents or guardians while walking in the Fort and you can bring your baby strollers as well. Speaking of children, there are fun things that they can do like flying kites in the Ramparts Green near the army base. 
Plus, the Galle Fort is one of, if not the most photogenic place in the South. The architectural beauty, the antique canons placed along the bastions, the scenic landscapes and the panoramic views coupled with glorious sunsets will make anyone want to preserve the memory through a photograph. The street side vendors and the locals who visit the fort are very friendly and will never say no if you ever want to photograph them in their candid beauty. All in all, one could say that it is one of the most accessible places for anyone who visits Galle city.

### Where to wine and dine: 

The Galle Fort is a food galore as it is the home to a number of local and international restaurants. From high-end fine dining restaurants to roadside kiosks that cook hot local delicacies, one could find almost anything that fits the palette.
