It’s an almost universally recognized fact that the beaches in Sri Lanka are beautiful and very famous among tourists, both local and foreign alike. Furthermore, the beaches in Galle such as Dewata Surf Beach , Dalawella Beach and Unawatuna Beach are still famous hubs of tourist activity. However, a coastal place that is relatively well known but still doesn’t get much tourist attraction is the Thalpe Beach. 

The Thalpe Beach is a calm and quiet place compared to most beaches that are occupied by tourists in the region and it is a place where one can go to escape the crowds and just relax to the sound of the waves of the ocean. To add to the serene atmosphere of the place, there is a wonderful little attraction in the distance called the Thalpe Coral Tanks (also known as the Coral Rock Pools of Thalpe).

According to the locals and sources about urban history of Thalpe, the rock pools were not always there as most people assume them to be. They were in fact cut out by the villagers who used them to soak coconut husks which is a part of the process in separating coconut coir from the husk. Even though the coconut industry still remains in the region as a prominent part of the local economy and as a part of its culture, the rock pools have long been abandoned and given back to nature. Nowadays, they are a relatively unknown yet seemingly sought out tourist attraction that has been growing in popularity in the recent years.

### Other things to do:

One other fun thing that you can do to relax and unwind, besides basking in the sun in the placid rock pools, is attending a cooking class for tourists! Yes, there are several places along the coast and the southern region that provide the exclusive experience of getting know the art of local cuisine in a fun and delightful way. The closest place to the rock pools is merely two kilometers inland and it is a place called the ‘Galle Unawatuna Cooking Class by AGS’. So, if you are enthusiastic about the culinary arts, then this is the place to experience just that.

However, if you don’t really want to do that, there are other things in the area that might interest you, things that have more to do with the ocean than food and cooking such as diving. There are multiple diving clubs along the southern coast and one of them is the Divers’ Land Dive club which is only 10 minutes (4.5km) away if you are travelling by car.

The rock pools have recently gained popularity via the internet because of a recent surge in the local travelers who visit the place solely because of its photogenic beauty. It has become sort of a trend to visit the rock pools because of this and if you are planning on visiting the rock pools, just know that it is in fact a beautiful place that you too might be compelled to take a photo in.
Plus, because of the calm and clear ocean waters in and around this area, stilt fishing (insert hyperlink) can also be seen in abundance. If you have the time, stilt fishing is also one thing you don’t want to miss! 


### When to visit: 

The best times to visit the Thalpe Rock Pools is during the months of April and May, mostly because those are the times when the weather conditions allow for clearer skies and calmer waters. This makes the whole atmosphere around the area bright, beautiful and inviting. During other times of the year, the rock pools get filled with sand and are not at all suitable for dipping in.

### How do I get there?

You can arrive at the Rock Pools once you get to Thalpe by travelling along the A2 road towards Matara until you go past Unawatuna and go a little bit further just beyond Mihiripenna. After Mihiripenna is Thalpe and once you get there, you can ask locals for direction to the rock pools or you can refer to a map or the billboards that point towards the destination. 

### What to wear and carry: 

The rock pools are overgrown with coral reefs and soft green algae so you don’t necessarily have to watch out for sharp edges that might sting or cut your skin but it is advised that you take extra care when walking along the reefs or just generally interacting with the rock pools. Other than that, there is not much to worry about in regards to what you need to wear since this is a part of a beach and beach clothes are always acceptable.

### Accessibility: 

The beach area is accessible to almost everyone but the rules regarding pets may vary in certain places so you might want to watch out for that. As for the rock pools, the level of accessibility is somewhat narrowed specially regarding the fact that the rock pools themselves need to be accessed by walking along the reefs. So, the elderly and the young ones might have to take a little bit of caution when walking along them since they could get slippery in certain places.

### Where to wine and dine: 

While the Wijaya Beach Restaurant shines as the best on the beach, there are quite a few places, not too far away from the beach that also offer unique dining experiences.
